# Statistical Method: Logistic Regression
In this example, we have implemented our very own Logistic Regression algorithm. Here, we have implemented a binary Logistic Regression algorithm, which takes -1 and 1 as our class labels. It will predict on the test dataset after training on the training dataset.

# Data
We have used the following datasets to run our algorithms:
1) A simulated dataset
2) Sklearn's **_digits_** dataset
3) The **_spam_** dataset [Spam Dataset](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/datasets/spam.data)

# Running the various codes

###### The demo_simulated.py will show you the performance of our algorithm on a simulated dataset. To run the demo_simulated.py file, run the following command:

```python demo_simulated.py
```

###### The demo_dataset.py will show you the performance of our algorithm on the digits dataset provided by sklearn. To run the demo_dataset.py file, run the following command:

```python demo_dataset.py
```

###### The demo_comparison.py file will show you how our Logistic Regression algorithm fares against sklearn's LogisticRegression algorithm. To run the demo_comparison.py file, run the following command:

```python demo_comparison.py
```
